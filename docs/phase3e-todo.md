# Phase 3e — Known Gaps & Follow-ups

Backlog captured at the end of the Phase 3d walkthrough. Not a commitment, just
a trackable list. Prioritize before starting a Phase 3e spec cycle.

---

## Dashboard / UX enhancements

### 3e.1 — Mark-to-market on Account card

**Observed:** The dashboard Account card shows `current_equity` (starting equity +
realized P&L + net cash). This is "settled cash" semantics, not "total account
value including unrealized P&L." On open positions with unrealized gains/losses,
the Account card doesn't reflect that.

**Proposed:** Add an "Unrealized P&L" line item under the Account card showing
`sum((snap.price - entry) * remaining_shares)` over open positions. Keep the
existing equity figure (it's important for position-sizing math), but give the
operator a mark-to-market view alongside.

**Rationale:** Brokerage apps show total account value; absence here is
surprising and easy to misread as "my P&L isn't moving."

**Scope:** ~1 template change + VM field. Phase 2 untouched.

---

### 3e.2 — Include realized-from-partial-exits in journal stats total

**Observed:** `swing journal review --period month` shows 0 trades / $0.00 total
when you have 1 partial exit recorded on a still-open trade. The realized $0.74
is in the DB and in the Account card, but not in the journal stats.

**Proposed:** Split the journal stats into two figures:
- **Closed-trade metrics** (existing): win rate, expectancy, avg win/loss, R multiples
  — require a full trade cycle to compute
- **Cash-realized total** (new): sum of `realized_pnl` across ALL exits in period,
  regardless of whether the trade is closed

**Rationale:** "What have I made this month?" should include locked-in partial
exits even on open trades. R-multiple math doesn't fit a partial, but dollar
P&L does.

**Scope:** Journal stats computation + review output. Phase 2 untouched.

---

### 3e.3 — `POST /prices/refresh` also clears OHLCV breaker

**Observed:** The /prices/refresh button bypasses PriceCache's circuit breaker
but doesn't touch OhlcvCache. If the OHLCV breaker is tripped, the operator
sees the "SMA advisories unavailable" banner with no interactive way to force
a retry.

**Proposed:** Extend the prices-refresh handler to also call
`ohlcv_cache.reset_circuit_breaker()`. OR add a separate `/ohlcv/refresh` button.

**Rationale:** Operator UX parity. Currently the OHLCV breaker only clears on
the 60s cooldown timer.

**Scope:** 1 route change + test. Phase 2 untouched.

---

## Watchlist UX bugs

### 3e.4 — Watchlist entries can expand but cannot collapse

**Observed:** Clicking a watchlist row expands it to show details. Clicking the
expanded row does nothing — no toggle/collapse. Operator has to refresh the
page to reset the view.

**Proposed:** Make the expand trigger a toggle (click again to collapse), OR
add an explicit collapse affordance (close X in the expanded panel).

**Scope:** 1 template + HTMX swap pattern change. Phase 2 untouched.

---

### 3e.5 — Stale placeholder text in expanded watchlist entries

**Observed:** Expanded watchlist entries contain the literal string:

> Log entry (CLI — 3b adds button)

This was a Phase 3a/3b placeholder for a "Log entry" button that would let the
operator annotate a watchlist row. The button was scoped to Phase 3b but never
shipped; the placeholder text was left in.

**Proposed:** Either ship the button (open a modal, insert a note row to
watchlist_notes table, display inline), OR remove the placeholder text.

**Recommendation:** Remove the placeholder for now; revisit the annotation
feature in a later phase when the need is clearer.

**Scope:** Simplest case — 1 template edit. Or 2 route + 1 migration + 1
template if we ship the button.

---

### 3e.6 — No graph pattern shape estimation

**Observed:** The app computes VCP tightness via range-CV and bar-ratio checks,
but doesn't emit a structural classification of the chart pattern (flag,
pennant, flat base, tight channel, cup-with-handle, etc.). The operator has to
chart-read each ticker manually to classify.

**Proposed:** Add a pattern classifier that runs on candidates and outputs a
shape tag. Minimal viable:
- Flat base: ≥ 5 weeks, range ≤ ~15%
- Flag: < 3 weeks, range tight, prior trend steep
- Pennant: similar to flag but converging ranges
- Cup-with-handle: multi-month U-shape + shallow pullback near pivot
- Tight channel: 2+ weeks of converging highs/lows

Render as a flag tag on the watchlist + briefing, same mechanism as `TT✓ VCP✓ A+`.

**Rationale:** Chart-reading is the high-value operator step; surfacing a
suggested pattern reduces cognitive load and provides a falsifiable claim
("model says flag — do I agree?").

**Scope:** Significant. New module under `swing/evaluation/patterns/`, likely 50–100
test cases over real historical examples, new flag_tag dictionary. Phase 2
carve-out probably required.

**Reference pattern images already in repo:**
- `reference/flag_pattern.png`
- `reference/pennant_pattern.png`
- `reference/tight_channel_flat_base.png`

## Summary

| ID | Area | Complexity | Phase 2 carve-out? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3e.1 | Unrealized P&L on Account card | Low | No |
| 3e.2 | Partial-exit realized in journal total | Low | No |
| 3e.3 | Prices-refresh clears OHLCV breaker | Low | No |
| 3e.4 | Watchlist collapse toggle | Low | No |
| 3e.5 | Remove stale "Log entry" placeholder | Trivial | No |
| 3e.6 | Chart pattern shape estimation | High | Probably yes |

3e.1–3e.5 are all small and could land as a single Phase 3e batch (~2–3 days
of work). 3e.6 is a standalone Phase 3f candidate.

## Tranche B-ops deferred items (2026-04-24)

Items surfaced during Tranche B-ops sessions 1 (design) and 2 (execution) that were deliberately deferred. See the session-1 design spec §8 (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-tranche-b-ops-session-1-design.md`) for full context on items marked (§8).

### From design (§8):

- **Pipeline-linkage bundle** — add `evaluation_run_id` FK on `pipeline_runs` + new `pipeline_chart_targets` table keyed on `(run_id, ticker)`. Would eliminate both chart-scope drift modes documented in spec §4 AND subsume the `insufficient-data` → `fetcher-failed` / `too-few-bars` split. Estimated ~1 pipeline-layer session. Phase 2 carve-out required.
- **Exit-form field preservation** — `TradeExitFormVM` has the same latent preservation gap as the stop form. No live bug; the spec scopes preservation specifically to the stop form. Low-effort follow-up.
- **ExitRationale enum distinct from ExitReason** — revisit when journal analysis produces evidence that `reason=partial|manual` rows corrupt downstream queries.
- **Total-book risk cap config** — `cfg.risk.max_total_risk_pct` + warn-coloring on the Open-risk tile. Deferred until evidence about the right default.
- **Book-equity-based Open-risk percent** — requires live prices in risk math. Current denominator is realized equity.
- **Chart-reason split: `insufficient-data` → `fetcher-failed` vs `too-few-bars`** — needs pipeline-layer per-ticker chart-status persistence. Subsumed by the pipeline-linkage bundle above.

### From Session 2 adversarial review:

- **Session-gating propagation for read-only surfaces** — `DashboardVM.stale_banner` currently does not propagate to watchlist/expand and other non-dashboard surfaces. Chart-scope resolver accepts the weekend/holiday drift for this reason. A future brainstorming session would design strict cross-UI session-gating. Spec-level decision required.
- **Transport/decode img failure fallback** — Session 2 C3 intentionally dropped `<img onerror>` per spec §4 rationale (transient static-mount errors "should page someone"). If real operational experience argues for a narrow client-side fallback distinct from the server-side intentional-absence states, reconsider. Low priority; monitor.

### From Session 3 adversarial review:

- **`TradeEntryFormVM.force` pre-existing dead field** — symmetric to the `TradeStopFormVM.force` removal shipped in Session 3 C5. No template consumer; no re-render usage. Session 3 declined to touch it mid-session per scope discipline. ~5-minute cleanup commit.
- **`(str, Enum)` → `StrEnum` migration across three enums** — `ExitReason`, `EntryRationale`, `StopAdjustRationale` all currently use the `(str, Enum)` pattern and carry `# noqa: UP042`. A single-commit migration clears all three `noqa` comments at once. Cohesive, small, low-priority.

---

## Tranche C deferred items (2026-04-25)

Items surfaced during Tranche C sessions (pipeline-linkage bundle, commits `f45dae8..1cfc117`; candidate-sparsity diagnostic, commits `1b33e21..bd0dae6`) that were deliberately deferred per scope discipline.

### From pipeline-linkage bundle:

- **`build_watchlist` mixed-anchor fix.** Same disease as today_decisions / candidates_by_ticker / _step_export had pre-Tranche-C; the standalone `/watchlist` page still reads via "latest eval" rather than `pipeline_run.evaluation_run_id`. Small commit (~30-60 min) now that the FK exists. File: `swing/web/view_models/watchlist.py:50-53` (the `SELECT id FROM evaluation_runs ORDER BY run_ts DESC LIMIT 1` query).
- **Stale `pipeline_chart_targets` rows on lease revoke.** When `_step_charts` writes `'pending'` rows then crashes / is force-cleared, those rows persist for the now-force_cleared `pipeline_runs` row. Resolver only reads `state='complete'` so they're inert, but accumulate over many failed runs. Worth a `sweep_stale_artifacts`-style addition if they grow.
- **"no-run" chart-reason wording inconsistency.** Pre-existing message says "for this session" but resolver is no longer session-gated. Revisit only if operators report confusion.
- **Per-ticker `fenced_write` granularity in `_step_charts`.** Each ticker outcome is its own `lease.fenced_write()` transaction (~15 small transactions per pipeline run). Acceptable now; if chart-step performance becomes a bottleneck, batching the per-ticker UPDATEs into a single fenced commit at end-of-step is straightforward.

### From candidate-sparsity diagnostic:

- **Hypothesis 5 — Production-vs-replay parity check.** The diagnostic's most-permissive matrix cell (Russell 3000 5×) reaches 0.0098%; production observation (Session 2a) is ~0.5%. **~50× residual gap unexplained** by universe + capital combined. Cheapest applied-research follow-on: side-by-side comparison of harness `evaluate_one` output vs production pipeline output for same inputs over the same window. Surfaces any silent code drift between research-branch reuse and production execution. Estimated ~1 session, applied-research scope.
- **Hypothesis 6 — Finviz universe reconstruction.** Most explanatory route to closing the residual gap but multi-week scope. Reconstructs the time-series of operator's actual Finviz-filtered universes to test universe-source hypothesis. Out of scope absent specific reason and time budget.
- **Newcombe interval on cross-universe rate difference.** Diagnostic R2 review noted the disjoint-CI rule has anti-conservative properties; a formal Newcombe interval on (p_C − p_A) would be the proper instrument. The qualitative-direction conclusion is robust to choice of test; nice-to-have refinement, not load-bearing.
- **Supplementary `--base-capital 100000 --capital-multiplier 1.0` parity run.** Would reproduce Session 2c's 11 A+ count (or surface a parity drift) and close the matrix's third capital interval [$37.5k, $100k]. Pre-authorized as thin follow-on if hypothesis-5 work happens.
- **`recompute_binding_prod_gated.py` parameterization.** Currently hardcoded against `build_harness_config()`. If a future diagnostic uses different criteria configurations, parameterize. Defer until that need arises (registry-maximalism risk per V2.1 anti-patterns).
- **Methodology lesson — production-gating-aware instrumentation as standing pattern.** Captured durably in `docs/orchestrator-context.md` §"Lessons captured." When instrumenting production logic for diagnostic measurement, mimic production's gating order, not criteria emission order. Future diagnostic instrumentation should adopt this pattern from the start.

### Capital-sensitivity finding disposition (informational):

The diagnostic established that risk_feasibility blocking is highly capital-sensitive in proportional terms but modest in deterministic A+ count terms. Operator (2026-04-25) declined to act: "the amount of money available is the amount of money available; without proven history, doesn't make sense to raise capital 2 orders of magnitude to go from 5 months to 2.5 months per A+ candidate." Recorded here so future operator/orchestrator sessions don't re-litigate.

---

## 2026-04-25 parallel-work follow-ups

Items surfaced during the parallel `build_watchlist` mixed-anchor fix (commit `77877c1`) and harness-vs-production parity check (commits `c47a783..1a88fb7`) that were deliberately deferred per scope discipline.

### From `build_watchlist` mixed-anchor fix:

- **Stale banner on `/watchlist`.** `WatchlistVM.stale_banner` is currently always `None` on the standalone `/watchlist` page despite being declared. On "new day, no fresh pipeline yet" workflows the page can render today's session_date alongside flag tags from the previous completed pipeline. Moderate-scope follow-on: touches `WatchlistVM`, `build_watchlist`, watchlist template; coordinates with the base-layout shared-VM gotcha listed in CLAUDE.md (every base-layout VM must gain new fields). Mirror `build_dashboard`'s stale_banner derivation at `dashboard.py:154-165`. Genuine UX gap; defer until you want to scope a session for it.
- **Deterministic tiebreaker on `ORDER BY finished_ts DESC LIMIT 1` (class-level pattern).** Several query sites in `swing/web/` (dashboard.py:107-111, 143-147, 155-159; watchlist.py uses the new pattern in `build_watchlist` post-`77877c1`; `build_watchlist_expanded` separately) use second-precision timestamp ordering without a deterministic tiebreaker. **Recommendation: defer indefinitely.** SQLite second-precision collision requires two pipeline completions in the same second — essentially impossible given pipeline runtime. Pre-existing across the layer; cost is small but value is theoretical until we see an actual collision in the wild. Capture here so a future session doesn't accidentally pick it up as urgent.

### From harness-vs-production parity check:

- **Multi-run parity characterization.** The Tier 1 result is on n=1 production run (eval_15, action_session 2026-04-25). For tighter inference, run the parity comparator across the last 5–6 production runs with preserved Finviz CSVs. Operator-decision gated; not urgent given the Tier 1 single-run result.
- **A+-surface-exercising parity run.** The n=80 eval_15 produced zero A+ candidates, so parity at A+ classification level is empirically unverified. Pick a historical production run that produced ≥1 A+; verify parity at A+ level. Not urgent given Tier 1 already verifies the watch/skip-level classification logic.
- **Parity comparator as periodic regression check.** Open question whether to run the parity comparator on every release or never again. **Recommendation: never-again unless a future change to `swing/evaluation/` or `research/harness/` specifically warrants it** (any change to the production scoring chain or the harness's evaluator wrapper). The comparator is durable in `research/parity/`; re-running is ~30 min when the question recurs.
- **`PriceFetcher` cache-stat introspection.** Production's `swing.prices.PriceFetcher` does not expose hit/miss counts; the parity comparator wrapped it in `_CountingPriceFetcher` (in `research/parity/run.py`) to report cache stats in the D3 manifest. Minor architectural gap; backlog item for if cache observability becomes operationally valuable elsewhere in the production layer.

---

## 2026-04-25 S&P 1500 study follow-ups

Items surfaced during the S&P 1500 universe expansion study (commits `a921e4b..4a372da`) that were deliberately deferred per scope discipline.

- **Newcombe interval on (S&P 1500 1× rate − SPX+NDX 1× rate).** Tier classification used point-estimate uplift per pre-registration; the per-rate Wilson CIs overlap, so a formal difference-of-proportions inference is open. The Newcombe interval would be the proper instrument. Nice-to-have refinement for tighter inference; not load-bearing for the descriptive Tier 2 finding.
- **Multi-window characterization on S&P 1500.** The Tier 2 result is a single-window observation. Rolling-window characterization (e.g., overlapping 6-month windows) would test rate stability across regimes within the broader 2024-04 → 2026-04 period. Operator-decision gated.
- **5× capital cell on S&P 1500.** Pre-registration scoped the study to 1× only (operator's actual capital). A 5× cell would complete a 4-cell matrix analogous to the candidate-sparsity diagnostic. Deferred per capital-sensitivity disposition (capital is informational, not workflow-changing).
- **Capital-binding-on-mid-caps interpretive finding (informational, not a follow-up task).** Production-gated risk_feasibility on S&P 1500 1× was 9.65% (vs SPX+NDX 18.62%, Russell 6.91%). At the operator's $7,500 capital, mid-cap universes fit the sizing budget BETTER than large-cap universes. Worth surfacing in any future operator-facing universe-decision conversation.
- **Byte-identical re-run with patched diagnostic_run for clean-checkout artifact proof.** D5 patch added `git_dirty` field to manifest for FUTURE runs; THIS D3 run's clean-checkout assertion remains procedural. Adversarial review accepted; orchestrator can request stronger artifact-level proof if needed. Low priority.

---

## 2026-04-25 — Proposed next study (SHIPPED 2026-04-25)

- ~~**Per-criterion binding-constraint analysis on operator's actual Finviz pool.**~~ SHIPPED. See `research/studies/finviz-pool-binding-constraints.md` for findings.

---

## 2026-04-25 Finviz-pool study + hypothesis-label follow-ups

Items surfaced during the Finviz-pool per-criterion analysis (commits `618cb9c..6ca6a40`) and trade hypothesis label Phase 3e change (commits `1cec5df..123f83c`).

### From Finviz-pool study:

- ~~**Watch-staging UI surface for near-A+ defensible candidates.**~~ SUBSUMED 2026-04-25 by hypothesis recommendation engine (commits `b24506b` → `fe270a6`). Near-A+ defensible candidates surface in the dashboard "Hypothesis-driven recommendations" section under the "Near-A+ defensible: extension test" hypothesis. SLDB/UCTT-class tickers automatically appear there when they recur as watch-bucket candidates failing only `proximity_20ma`.
- **Longer-window Finviz-pool re-run after 30-60 days more data accumulates.** Same study module (`research/finviz_pool_analysis/`); just re-execute. The 8-day single-ticker SLDB-population caveat resolves naturally as more daily Finviz CSVs accumulate. Estimated 30 minutes once enough data exists; useful for operator to confirm or revise the descriptive findings.
- **Path-resolution policy for renamed-rejected CSVs.** Implementer flagged: 1 evaluation_run skipped because its CSV was renamed to `data/finviz-inbox/rejected/finviz16Apr2026.rejected-20260419T064456.csv`. Strict literal-basename match was implemented; stem-prefix match could include rejected runs. **Defer indefinitely.** 1 run affected; semantics could go either way; not load-bearing.
- **Single-ticker A+ population caveat.** All 3 A+ rows in the 8-day snapshot were SLDB on 2 dates. Inherent limitation of a small window; resolves with longer-window re-run above. Not a follow-up task; documented limitation.

### From hypothesis-label Phase 3e change:

- ~~**Backfill of historical trades (VIR).**~~ DONE 2026-04-25. After `swing db-migrate` applied schema 7, ran `UPDATE trades SET hypothesis_label = 'sub-A+ VCP-not-formed test (proximity_20ma + tightness fails); inaugural trade test' WHERE id = 1;` against production DB. n=1 historical trade now labeled.
- **Future formalization to controlled vocabulary.** Free-text initially per operator confirmation; once 5+ labeled trades reveal natural categories, formalization to enum + validation is a follow-on. Not urgent.

### Cross-cutting: Post-hoc trade analysis CLI tool

- ~~**`swing trade analyze <trade_id>` retrospective tool.**~~ SHIPPED 2026-04-25 (commits `375344f` cross-contaminated + `2815daa` + `4c2fdbd` → `d5b1753`). VIR verification reproduces manual case-study output exactly. Handles both production-recommended and manually-sourced trades.

### Operational hygiene

- ~~**Weekly DB backups during the first pipeline run of the calendar week.**~~ SHIPPED 2026-04-25 (commits `4a565c6` → `1540489`). WAL-safe via `sqlite3.Connection.backup()` API. Auto-backup verified working in operator's mid-session db-migrate.

### Chart-pattern algorithm framing note (cross-reference)

Per `docs/orchestrator-context.md` 2026-04-25 binding-constraint analysis: chart-pattern algorithm (Phase 3e §3e.6) is for **encoding qualitative chart-pattern input into structured feedback-loop data**, NOT for throughput acceleration (operator can manually assess at saturation rate). Important addition; not urgent. Multi-session copowers cycle when ready. Hypothesis-label free-text absorbs qualitative chart-pattern input as interim solution.

---

## 2026-04-25 Bug 1 follow-ups (watchlist Enter-button event-propagation)

Items raised by Codex during Bug 1's adversarial review (commit `9aabe8b` shipped) and accepted-with-rationale per scope-bounded brief. Captured here for future-session pickup; not urgent but real architectural concerns.

- **Watchlist row HTMX trigger architecture refactor.** The current row design — `<tr hx-get="/watchlist/<ticker>/expand">` makes the entire row a click target — means any interactive child added to the row (button, input, link) has to remember `onclick="event.stopPropagation()"`. Bug 1's fix is a point-fix at the Enter button; it doesn't prevent recurrence with future interactive children (e.g., when Phase 3e §3e.5's "Log entry" button replaces the existing CLI placeholder in `watchlist_expanded.html.j2:33`). Two architectural alternatives:
  - **Option A: dedicated chevron cell** — move the expand trigger from the row to a leftmost `<td class="expand-trigger">` chevron. Visual UI change; explicit affordance for expand.
  - **Option B: scope the trigger** — use `hx-trigger="click from:td.row-trigger"` to limit the row's expand trigger to a specific cell or class. Invisible to user; same effect as Option A.
  - **Recommendation when scoped:** Option B unless operator wants the chevron UI affordance. Estimated ~1-2 sessions including tests. Picks itself up when more row-level controls ship.
- **JS-execution test harness gap.** Project currently uses FastAPI TestClient + assertion on rendered HTML strings for web-layer tests. Sufficient for server-side rendering correctness; INSUFFICIENT for JavaScript event behavior, HTMX runtime swap targeting, DOM updates after script execution, and CSS-driven visual states. Bug 1's fix test (string-match `stopPropagation`) confirms the attribute is present but does NOT confirm the runtime behavior is correct — operator manual verification is the actual confidence source. Adding a JS test harness (Playwright or Selenium) would close this gap but adds: heavy dependency (chromium driver), slow tests (browser startup overhead), flakiness risk (timing-dependent failures), CI complexity. **Recommendation: defer** until either (a) 5+ event-handling-related bugs accumulate, (b) chart-pattern algorithm or other rich-UI work approaches and would benefit, or (c) manual verification becomes a bottleneck. When scoped: ~2-4 sessions for harness setup + CI integration + re-architecture of test patterns. For now, manual verification remains the JS-behavior testing surface for the project.

---

## 2026-04-25 Bug 2 follow-ups (trade entry form vanishes mid-typing)

Items flagged by the Bug 2 investigation (commits `04ef355` → `20d2cab` shipped) as defense-in-depth opportunities and pre-existing degradations not in the fix scope.

- **`_handle_any` HX-Target-awareness (defense-in-depth).** `swing/web/app.py:69-85`'s generic exception handler `_handle_any` is NOT HX-Target-aware — it always returns the bare `<div class="banner banner-degraded">` `error_fragment.html.j2` for HTMX requests, regardless of target prefix. By contrast, `_handle_http_exc` IS row-aware (returns `trade_form_error.html.j2` — a `<tr>` — for row-prefixed targets). This inconsistency means **any future unhandled non-HTTPException in any row-target route would reproduce Bug 2's symptom shape** (the `<div>` gets hoisted out of `<tbody>` by the HTML parser, row position empty, refresh required). The Bug 2 investigation audited all known row-target routes (`entry_post`, `exit_post`, `stop_post`, `trade_cancel`, `entry_form`) — only `entry_post` had the gap, now fixed. **Recommendation: ~2-line change to `_handle_any`** mirroring `_handle_http_exc`'s `_is_row_swap_target(request)` check + select `trade_form_error.html.j2` for row targets. Closes the latent risk for ANY future row-target route. ~30-60 min including a regression test that monkeypatches a row-target route to raise an unrelated exception and asserts the response is row-shaped. Defense-in-depth — not urgent, but cheap and durable.
- **Sizing-hint hx-trigger parsing bug (pre-existing behavioral degradation).** Current trigger string in `partials/trade_entry_form.html.j2` (sizing-hint span): `change from:input[name=entry_price],input[name=initial_stop] delay:200ms`. Per HTMX 2.0.3's tokenizer, this parses as TWO separate triggers because HTMX splits on top-level commas: (1) `change` event from `input[name=entry_price]` with NO delay (delay:200ms attaches to the second trigger only); (2) `input` event with broken filter expression `[name=initial_stop]` which compiles into `event.name = (event.initial_stop ?? window.initial_stop)` — always evaluates undefined → never fires. Net effect: sizing-hint fires correctly on entry_price changes (without intended debounce) but NEVER fires on initial_stop changes. **Recommendation:** likely fix is HTMX's parens-grouped from-selector syntax: `change from:(input[name=entry_price],input[name=initial_stop]) delay:200ms`. Verify against HTMX 2.0.3 behavior (test in browser; check HTMX docs). ~30 min including a smoke test that asserts both fields trigger sizing-hint requests with debounce. Behavioral degradation; affects sizing feedback UX but not correctness.

### Bug 2 root-cause fix history note (informational, not a follow-up)

Bug 2's actual root cause was **not** the form-submit ValueError path that the first fix attempt (`04ef355` → `20d2cab`) addressed. The actual mechanism was sizing-hint span `hx-target` inheritance from parent `<form>`: the span had no explicit `hx-target`, so it inherited `hx-target="closest tr"` from the form, causing every sizing-hint hx-get response to swap into the entry-form `<tr>` position — replacing the entire form with just the sizing-hint span. Real fix: `2a167d1` adds explicit `hx-target="this"` to the sizing-hint span (one-line). The first fix is preserved as defense-in-depth (correct behavior for actual form submission with stop≥entry). Lesson captured in `docs/orchestrator-context.md` anti-patterns: "Bug-fix investigation that tests plausible mechanisms instead of operator's actual reproduction"; mitigation in operating-processes via investigation-phase operator-confirmation gate for INVESTIGATION-FIRST bug-fix briefs.

## 2026-04-25 hypothesis-engine + analyze + backup follow-ups

Items surfaced from the Monday-prep operational batch (commits `4a565c6` → `fe270a6`).

### From hypothesis-recommendation engine work:

- **WatchlistVM extension for active recommendations** (optional). hyp2 declined per scope discipline — dashboard + CLI pre-fill cover the primary loop; the watchlist page already shows flag tags. If operator wants the standalone `/watchlist` page to also list active recommendations, clean follow-up: add `active_recommendations` field to `WatchlistVM`; render the same partial in the watchlist template. ~30 min work.
- **Monitor for first hypothesis closure → revisit longer-horizon planning.** Per orchestrator-context.md 2026-04-25 entry: when the first hypothesis closes (target sample met OR tripwire-fired escape), revisit the longer-horizon planning question with operator. Likely first to close: Sub-A+ VCP-not-formed (5-sample target; VIR is sample 1) or A+ baseline (20-sample) depending on operator's actual identification + take pace.
- **Hypothesis registry-mutation discipline (operator-facing).** Per pre-registration discipline, only `status` is mutable via `swing hypothesis update`. To add a NEW hypothesis or change target_sample / tripwire / decision_criteria of existing hypotheses requires a formal new migration (e.g., `0009_hypothesis_v0.2_amendment.sql`). This boundary is a feature, not a limitation; preserves anti-rationalization integrity. If operator decides to add hypothesis 5 (e.g., post-first-closure planning), it's a small Phase 2 carve-out: new migration + seed.

### From `swing trade analyze` CLI work:

- **Cross-contamination commit-title misattribution.** Commits `375344f` (titled "feat(pipeline): trigger weekly DB backup...") and `43b4d35` (titled "feat(cli): add db-backup subcommand...") accidentally bundled trade-analyze implementer's work due to parallel `git add` race. Code is correct; commit titles are misattributed. Could be addressed via git notes if attribution preservation matters; recommendation per orchestrator-context.md 2026-04-25 lesson is to leave as-is (the lesson is durable; archaeology fix is administrative overhead). Future parallel dispatches should use git worktrees to prevent this class of issue.

### From weekly DB backup work:

- (No follow-ups; clean implementation.)
