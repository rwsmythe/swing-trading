# Phase 3e — Known Gaps & Follow-ups

Backlog captured at the end of the Phase 3d walkthrough. Not a commitment, just
a trackable list. Prioritize before starting a Phase 3e spec cycle.

## Dashboard / UX enhancements

### 3e.1 — Mark-to-market on Account card

**Observed:** The dashboard Account card shows `current_equity` (starting equity +
realized P&L + net cash). This is "settled cash" semantics, not "total account
value including unrealized P&L." On open positions with unrealized gains/losses,
the Account card doesn't reflect that.

**Proposed:** Add an "Unrealized P&L" line item under the Account card showing
`sum((snap.price - entry) * remaining_shares)` over open positions. Keep the
existing equity figure (it's important for position-sizing math), but give the
operator a mark-to-market view alongside.

**Rationale:** Brokerage apps show total account value; absence here is
surprising and easy to misread as "my P&L isn't moving."

**Scope:** ~1 template change + VM field. Phase 2 untouched.

### 3e.2 — Include realized-from-partial-exits in journal stats total

**Observed:** `swing journal review --period month` shows 0 trades / $0.00 total
when you have 1 partial exit recorded on a still-open trade. The realized $0.74
is in the DB and in the Account card, but not in the journal stats.

**Proposed:** Split the journal stats into two figures:
- **Closed-trade metrics** (existing): win rate, expectancy, avg win/loss, R multiples
  — require a full trade cycle to compute
- **Cash-realized total** (new): sum of `realized_pnl` across ALL exits in period,
  regardless of whether the trade is closed

**Rationale:** "What have I made this month?" should include locked-in partial
exits even on open trades. R-multiple math doesn't fit a partial, but dollar
P&L does.

**Scope:** Journal stats computation + review output. Phase 2 untouched.

---

### 3e.3 — `POST /prices/refresh` also clears OHLCV breaker

**Observed:** The /prices/refresh button bypasses PriceCache's circuit breaker
but doesn't touch OhlcvCache. If the OHLCV breaker is tripped, the operator
sees the "SMA advisories unavailable" banner with no interactive way to force
a retry.

**Proposed:** Extend the prices-refresh handler to also call
`ohlcv_cache.reset_circuit_breaker()`. OR add a separate `/ohlcv/refresh` button.

**Rationale:** Operator UX parity. Currently the OHLCV breaker only clears on
the 60s cooldown timer.

**Scope:** 1 route change + test. Phase 2 untouched.

---

## Watchlist UX bugs

### 3e.4 — Watchlist entries can expand but cannot collapse

**Observed:** Clicking a watchlist row expands it to show details. Clicking the
expanded row does nothing — no toggle/collapse. Operator has to refresh the
page to reset the view.

**Proposed:** Make the expand trigger a toggle (click again to collapse), OR
add an explicit collapse affordance (close X in the expanded panel).

**Scope:** 1 template + HTMX swap pattern change. Phase 2 untouched.

---

### 3e.5 — Stale placeholder text in expanded watchlist entries

**Observed:** Expanded watchlist entries contain the literal string:

> Log entry (CLI — 3b adds button)

This was a Phase 3a/3b placeholder for a "Log entry" button that would let the
operator annotate a watchlist row. The button was scoped to Phase 3b but never
shipped; the placeholder text was left in.

**Proposed:** Either ship the button (open a modal, insert a note row to
watchlist_notes table, display inline), OR remove the placeholder text.

**Recommendation:** Remove the placeholder for now; revisit the annotation
feature in a later phase when the need is clearer.

**Scope:** Simplest case — 1 template edit. Or 2 route + 1 migration + 1
template if we ship the button.

---

### 3e.6 — No graph pattern shape estimation

**Observed:** The app computes VCP tightness via range-CV and bar-ratio checks,
but doesn't emit a structural classification of the chart pattern (flag,
pennant, flat base, tight channel, cup-with-handle, etc.). The operator has to
chart-read each ticker manually to classify.

**Proposed:** Add a pattern classifier that runs on candidates and outputs a
shape tag. Minimal viable:
- Flat base: ≥ 5 weeks, range ≤ ~15%
- Flag: < 3 weeks, range tight, prior trend steep
- Pennant: similar to flag but converging ranges
- Cup-with-handle: multi-month U-shape + shallow pullback near pivot
- Tight channel: 2+ weeks of converging highs/lows

Render as a flag tag on the watchlist + briefing, same mechanism as `TT✓ VCP✓ A+`.

**Rationale:** Chart-reading is the high-value operator step; surfacing a
suggested pattern reduces cognitive load and provides a falsifiable claim
("model says flag — do I agree?").

**Scope:** Significant. New module under `swing/evaluation/patterns/`, likely 50–100
test cases over real historical examples, new flag_tag dictionary. Phase 2
carve-out probably required.

## Summary

| ID | Area | Complexity | Phase 2 carve-out? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3e.1 | Unrealized P&L on Account card | Low | No |
| 3e.2 | Partial-exit realized in journal total | Low | No |
| 3e.3 | Prices-refresh clears OHLCV breaker | Low | No |
| 3e.4 | Watchlist collapse toggle | Low | No |
| 3e.5 | Remove stale "Log entry" placeholder | Trivial | No |
| 3e.6 | Chart pattern shape estimation | High | Probably yes |

3e.1–3e.5 are all small and could land as a single Phase 3e batch (~2–3 days
of work). 3e.6 is a standalone Phase 3f candidate.
